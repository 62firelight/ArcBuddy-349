# Arc Buddy

Arc Buddy is a web application that uses the [Bungie.Net API](https://bungie-net.github.io/) to give quality-of-life features for [Destiny 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1085660/Destiny_2/) players. Examples of these features include being able to look up player stats and save "snapshots" of player stats.

Currently, Arc Buddy is more of a "proof-of-concept" than anything else. I mainly created it for personal use so that I could test the functions (of which there are many) of the Bungie.Net API using somewhat familiar frameworks.

## Architecture

## Special Thanks

* Bungie for providing such an extensive API ([GitHub](https://github.com/Bungie-net/api))
* brandonmanke for providing an easy-to-use API wrapper that made calling the API much easier ([GitHub](https://github.com/brandonmanke/node-destiny-2))
